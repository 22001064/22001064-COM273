   - Click **Code** then **Download Zip**
   - Unzipe the downloaded file to your computer

## Usage

- AI Mode: Where you can play against the Stockfish AI, you can use the set_depth(N) command in the engine.py to set a search depth (as default it's set to 10), or you can change the Elo Rating there to something other than 1000.
